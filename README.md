## Download ##

Get this Stash workflow for Alfred from [GitHub][gh-releases] or [Packal][packal-page]. See this [guide][alfred-workflow-installation] on how to install a workflow in Alfred (basically, you just have to open the file by double-clicking on it).


## Usage ##

- `stash repos [query]` â€” View/search for repositories in Stash
	+ `â†©` â€” Open repository page on Stash in your browser
	+ `âŒ˜+C` â€” Copy repository's clone URL to your clipboard
- `stash projects [query]` â€” View/search for projects in Stash
	+ `â†©` Open project page on Stash in your browser
- `stash pullrequests [query]` â€” View/search for pull requests to review for the configured user in Stash
	+ `â†©` Open pull request page on Stash in your browser


## Configuration ##

You have to configure the parameters for connecting to your Stash instance. Use the following commands:

- `stash config host [host_url]` â€” Configure the URL to your Stash host
- `stash config user [user_name]` â€” Configure the name of your Stash user
- `stash config password [password]` â€” Configure the password of your Stash user (will be stored encrypted in Keychain)
- `stash config verifycert [true|false]` â€” Enable/disable certificate verification for your connection to Stash (if you use a self-signed certificate, you might want to disable this)

If you want to verify if your connection parameters are valid, use the following command:

- `stash config check` â€” Verifies if a connection to Stash can be established by using the entered connection parameters

Further configuration commands:

- `stash config delcache` â€” Deletes the cached Stash infos


## Icons ##

After a repository name you might sometimes see the following icons:

| Icon |                    Description                    |
|------|---------------------------------------------------|
|  â‘‚   | Repository is a fork                              |
|  ðŸ”“   | Public repository                                 |
